# Uses

I personally really like reading what other developers and people use on a daily basis. To code, to work, communicate, how they organize their thoughts etc. [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses) and [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/blog/laracasts-uses) are two notable examples. I think it's a powerful educational tool, so I would like to share. Hopefully, I'll keep this page up to date. You can look at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for more.

## Office stuff

I've been working from home full-time since March 2020, but even before then I would ocasionally work from home so I already had a pretty decent setup.

- [Autonomous AI SmartDesk Pro XL Classic](https://www.autonomous.ai/en-CA/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business)<br/>
  I don't use it as much as I should, but having a sit-stand desk is really great. My new webcam's cable is too short so I haven't worked standing up in a while now. I just need to buy a new cable, but I'm lazy. I got the matte black top with grey frame. Reason I went with the pro is the better weight capacity and range of motion. It was really easy to assemble, so far it's been rock solid.
- [Steelcase Gesture with headrest](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/) (pending) <br/>
  I ordered it recently and I'm waiting for it to give my thoughts. Prior to this, I used a very large ergonomic chair provided by my job, but while I wait for the new chair, I'm using a chair from our dining table.
- [IKEA MARKUS chair without the armrests](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/) (current) <br>
  Yes, you read that right. My wife thought I was crazy, my parents made fun of me and I don't care. Having affordable office chairs on wheels around a kitchen table is <em>awesome</em>. Before the pandemic, we used to play boardgames and RPGs a lot there with my brother, cousins and friends. Regular chairs are not as durable as office chairs so I just decided to give it a shot. It's a pain to move with them, but they are really great. Not ideal to work on for long hours, but they are better than straight chairs. I took out the armrests because I like to move around, cross my legs etc. and it's not really feasible with my frame on that chair. That's why I'm getting the Gesture. I can't wait.
- **[Custom Build PC](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FDLT8J)**<br/>
  This is my main gaming and home coding PC. I use Windows 11 at the moment.

- [3x Asus 28" 4k Ultra HD (VG289Q)](https://www.asus.com/ca-en/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/TUF-Gaming/TUF-Gaming-VG289Q/)
  I've had two of them for over a year now and I got an extra one to use as a vertical monitor. I've noticed some image rentention issue (LCD burn-in) and I had to reduce to overall brightness of my monitors to prevent further issues. I hope I don't need to replace them in the future because they are great.

- [MacBook Pro 14"](https://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-pro-14-and-16/)
  This is my work laptop. The 14" and 16" models allow to plug in multiple monitors, which is essential for my workflow. I personally purchased the first gen 13" model which had a touchbar and never really cared for it, so I'm glad the new model got rid of it. I don't mind the notch at all and the additional realestage from the 13 to the 14 inch model is noticable and appreciated.
- [Blue Yeti Microphone](https://www.bluemic.com/en-ca/products/yeti/) with the [Blue Compass boomarm](https://www.bluemic.com/en-ca/products/compass/) <br/>
  I got this at the beginning of the pandemic when it became obvious we'd be working from home for a while. I think people don't understand how the sound quality of their microphone impacts how people perceive you in a remote environment. If room has a lot of echo or your voice is distorted or you breathe into your cheap microphone, you're probably not the only one. But if you use a quality microphone, you stand out and your voice will be clear. The reason why I got the boom arm is because this particular microphone needs to be closer to your mouth and having it on an arm away from the keyboard is more optimal. The arm is not ideal to be honest. I might replace it at some point for something more flexible.
- [Logitech StreamCam](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/webcams/streamcam.960-001286.html) <br/>
  It's fine. It's miles better than your average potato webcam at least. I used to have a Razer Kiyo Pro but it was such a headache. It kept cutting or freezing. When I got rid of everything Razer (and their software is also terrible) to go full Logitech, I just decided to go with this. The image quality is fine and I can't bring myself to get a DSLR just for meetings yet. <article-image src="logitech-streamcam-sample.jpg" alt="Sample image of Logitech Streamcam"></article-image>
- [Beyerdynamic-DT-1770-PRO-Headphones](https://www.amazon.ca/beyerdynamic-DT-1770-PRO-Headphones/dp/B0142FEWD4) <br/>
  Definitely overkill. I don't claim to be an audiophile, but I got into a spiral of wathcing audio videos when I decided to get a new microphone and settled on those. I used to have a DAC-AMP to go with it, but honestly they are so sensitive they do a great job directly plugged in my PC. So when I accidentally knocked the DAC-AMP and it broke, it wasn't a huge loss.
- [Airpods Max](https://www.apple.com/ca/airpods-max/) <br/>
  I got those because I don't want to plug/unplug my Blue Yeti and my Beyerdynamic headphones every day. The microphone quality is better than on the Airpods Pro.
- [Logitech G915 mechanical keyboard](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gaming-keyboards/g915-low-profile-wireless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard.html) and [Logitech G502 Lightspeed wireless mouse](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gaming-mice/g502-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-005565.html)<br />
  This replaced my Razer combo. The battery life is great and the keyboard allows you to connect to two device and swap between the two easily.
- [Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MK2E3AM/A/magic-mouse-white-multi-touch-surface) <br />
  This is what I use for the MacBook. It's fine. I'm thinking about getting a KVM switch for the whole setup, but for now this is fine.
