        I'm a software developer, public servant and husband. I'm passionate
        about web accessibility and making the web better. I'm also a huge nerd
        with too many tabletop role-playing games and I like to write about that
        too.

        I had a tiny blog back in the day on Blogger (whew) where I reviewed
        tabletop RPGs. I even got sent some games to review by publishers and it
        was great. I kind of miss doing that so I'm starting again. If you want
        to send me something to look at, you can email me at
        <a href="mailto:patrick.joannisse@hey.com?subject=Review request"
